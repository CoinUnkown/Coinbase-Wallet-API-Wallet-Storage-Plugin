 # Coin Base

Okcash Cold Storage - 
New coin base

One of the most popular options for keeping your Okcash safe is something called an OK Coin Base.
Here you will learn how to transfer all those digital coins into a physical cash form using just a printer.



### What is an OK Coin Base and why do I need one?

An OkCoin Base consists of two ‘keys’. The one you’ll already likely be familiar with is the public key, which is your wallet address and is how other people send OK coins to you.

The other part of your OkCoin Base is the private key. It is this that enables you to send OK to other people.

The combination of the recipient’s public key and your private key is what makes a cryptocurrency transaction possible.

It is important to understand that, if anyone else obtains the private key of your wallet,
they can withdraw your funds – this is why it’s absolutely essential that nobody else discovers it.

So, if you keep your coins in either an online wallet, or a hard-drive-based software wallet,
you are vulnerable to attacks by hackers or malware that can log your keystrokes.

Furthermore, a stolen PC or a hard-drive crash could also see you waving bye-bye to your digital treasure.

Used with care, a Coin Base can protect you from these possibilities.

## What is an OK Coin Base?

A Coin Base is a document that contains copies of the public and private keys that make up a wallet.
Often it will have QR codes, so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys into a software wallet to make a transaction.

The benefit of a Coin Base is that the keys are not stored digitally anywhere,
and are therefore not subject to cyber-attacks or hardware failures.

The disadvantage of a Coin Base is that cash and ink can degrade,
and cash is relatively fragile – it’s definitely worth keeping well away from fire and water for obvious reasons.

Furthermore, if you lose a Coin Base, you’ll never be able to access the OK coins sent to its address.
